Thanks for using Koala! Sorry you've run into an issue ðŸ˜“  Here are some questions to help get things figured out as quickly as possible.

Obviously not all code can be shared -- feel free to put variables in place of any sensitive information and describe what should be used to replicate it.

Thanks for submitting an issue! Looking forward to working with you to figure it out.
